# DreamInEngine_2.0
A 2D game maker made in C++ with OpenGL and Box2D, it also works with an ECS design.
I am doing this gamer maker with Valentin Dumas, another student from my school (https://github.com/ValentinDumas)

You can't use it right now but we are working on it so that you can do the basic step of a game maker befor the 24 september 2018. We hope that you understand.
