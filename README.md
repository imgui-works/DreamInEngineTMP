# DreamInEngine
Since the very beginning of this project, DreamInEngine is designed to 
be a 2D game maker made in C++ with OpenGL, ImGUI and Box2D.
It also respect an ECS design for maximum performance and flexibility.

The engine is made by myself and by Thomas Bisson, another student from my school (https://github.com/ThomasBisson)

I am personnaly working very hard on this because I plan to do at least a 2D release (v1.0) on January 2019 and a 3D release (v2.0) on August 2019.
